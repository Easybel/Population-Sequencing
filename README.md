# Population-Sequencing

-the scripts are sorted by number 
-script 0 is for the design of mock reads if that is what you want to do 
-if the number of the script is followed by a letter (for example 3a and 3b) those scripts denote different options for the same step in the analysis 
the options might differ depending on the type of input data (for example data from a mockgenome or real data)
-scripts that are named beginnning with O1...Ox are optional and do not have to be used necessarily 
-scripts that are named beginning with P1...Px contain scripts for plotting and visualization
